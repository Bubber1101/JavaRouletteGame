# JavaRouletteGame
A simple game of roulette I made for my GUI classes.
The player gets a certain ammount of credits ( visible to the right) which they can spend on bets. When they run out of credits the game ends.
Player can make bets on the numbers(using left mouse button) and colors (right mouse button).
After a bet was made the "Roll the Roulette" button should be clicked.
The result of a roll is noted in the history to the left as well as displayed on the top.
If the player wins a bet, a row of baloons flies through the screen.
